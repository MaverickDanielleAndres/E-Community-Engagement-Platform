# E-Community Project Phases Documentation

## I. Preliminary Investigation

### 1. Request Clarification
The project aims to develop a comprehensive community management system that allows residents to submit complaints, provide feedback, participate in polls, and interact with administrators. The system supports multiple user roles (Admin, Resident, Guest) with appropriate access controls.

### 2. Feasibility Study
- **Technical Feasibility**: The project uses modern web technologies (Next.js, Supabase, NextAuth) which are well-established and suitable for the requirements.
- **Economic Feasibility**: Open-source technologies reduce development costs.
- **Operational Feasibility**: The system provides intuitive interfaces for all user types.
- **Schedule Feasibility**: The project scope is manageable within typical development timelines.

### 3. Project Initiation
- **Project Title**: E-Community Management System
- **Project Objectives**:
  - Provide a platform for community residents to submit and track complaints
  - Enable feedback submission and management
  - Support community polls and voting
  - Implement role-based access control
  - Provide administrative tools for community management
- **Project Scope**: Web-based application with user authentication, complaint management, feedback system, polling system, and administrative dashboard.

## II. System Analysis

### 1. Requirement Determination
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - User registration and authentication with email verification
  - Role-based access (Admin, Resident, Guest)
  - Complaint submission, tracking, and resolution
