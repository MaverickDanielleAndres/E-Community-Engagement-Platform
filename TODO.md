# Admin Notifications Page Enhancement - TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add delete functionality for individual notifications
- [x] Add clear all notifications functionality
- [x] Update columns to include actions column with delete button
- [x] Add confirmation dialogs for delete and clear all actions
- [x] Add toast notifications for success/error feedback
- [x] Update UI layout with clear all button in header
- [x] Fix TypeScript errors and type definitions
- [x] Add DELETE method to API endpoint for delete and clear all operations

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test the delete functionality with API endpoint
- [ ] Test the clear all functionality with API endpoint
- [ ] Verify real-time updates work with delete operations
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness on different screen sizes

## Notes
- Used similar patterns from requests page for consistency
- Added actions?: string to Notification interface to match DataTable expectations
- Clear all button only shows when there are notifications to clear
- All actions require confirmation dialogs for safety
- API endpoint now supports DELETE with ?id=<id> for single delete and ?clear=true for clear all

# Fix Verification Requests 500 Error and Dialog Issue

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fixed backend bug in user status update destructuring (changed from { error, count } to { data, error } for Supabase update)
- [x] Fixed frontend confirmation dialog not closing after action (made action async and close dialog after await)
- [x] Updated both approve and reject user status update logic to use correct Supabase response structure

## Notes
- The 500 error was caused by incorrect destructuring of Supabase update response, where count was undefined, causing the check to fail
- Dialog issue was due to synchronous action not closing the dialog after completion
- Now approval/rejection should work without 500 error and dialog closes immediately after confirming
