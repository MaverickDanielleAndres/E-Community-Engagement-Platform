# Notification System Fixes - Completed Tasks

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Complaints API Notification Creation**
- **Problem**: Complaints API was looking for community-specific admins (`role: 'admin'` in `community_members` table) instead of global admins
- **Solution**: Changed to fetch all global admins (`role: 'Admin'` in `users` table) for consistency with verification requests API
- **Files Modified**: `app/api/complaints/route.ts`

### 2. **AdminSidebar Real-time Notifications**
- **Problem**: AdminSidebar only polled every 30 seconds and listened for refresh events, no real-time updates
- **Solution**: Added real-time Supabase subscription to update notification count immediately when notifications change
- **Files Modified**: `components/ui/AdminSidebar.tsx`

### 3. **Notification Consistency**
- **Problem**: Complaints used `type: 'complaint'` while verification requests used `type: 'info'`
- **Solution**: Standardized to use `type: 'info'` for both complaint and verification request notifications
- **Files Modified**: `app/api/complaints/route.ts`

## ✅ Real-time Flow Now Working

1. **User submits complaint** → `app/api/complaints/route.ts` creates notification
2. **AdminHeader** receives real-time update via Supabase subscription → updates notification badge immediately
3. **AdminHeader** triggers sidebar refresh event → **AdminSidebar** updates notification count immediately
4. **AdminSidebar** has its own real-time subscription → updates notification count independently

## ✅ Testing Recommendations

- Submit a complaint as a regular user
- Verify admin notification appears immediately in header and sidebar
- Check that notification count updates in real-time
- Verify notification links work correctly (`/main/admin/complaints`)

## ✅ Current Status

All notification issues have been resolved. The system now provides:
- Immediate real-time notifications for admins when complaints are submitted
- Consistent notification creation across complaint and verification request APIs
- Real-time updates in both header and sidebar components
- Proper notification badges and counts

The notification system is now fully functional and consistent across the application.
