# Fix Admin Members Page Issues

## Issues to Fix:
1. **TypeScript Errors**: Interface mismatch between API response and frontend expectations
2. **403 Forbidden Error**: Admin authentication issues
3. **Data Structure Mismatch**: API returns different structure than frontend expects

## Plan:
1. [ ] Fix Member interface in frontend to match API response structure
2. [ ] Update API to return data in expected format (created_at, updated_at)
3. [ ] Add better error handling and debugging information
4. [ ] Ensure proper admin authentication works correctly
5. [ ] Test the complete flow

## Files to Edit:
- app/main/admin/members/page.tsx (Frontend interface and data handling)
- app/api/admin/members/route.ts (API response format and auth)
- app/api/admin/members/[id]/route.ts (Individual member operations)
