# TODO: Fix AuthForm and Input Component Layout Issues

## Tasks
- [ ] Update AuthForm.tsx to pass `isDark` prop to all Input components
- [ ] Adjust label positioning in Input.tsx to prevent overlaps (change top to -0.25rem and ensure background padding)
- [ ] Enhance focus styles in Input.tsx for better visual feedback
- [ ] Verify all classNames use template strings consistently

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the form layout in both light and dark modes to ensure no overlaps and proper focus behavior
